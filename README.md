 What is it?
  -----------
	This is an arcade game which simulates a treasure cave overrun by poisonous cockroaches. The purpose of the game is to collect as much treasure showing up in the screen at different random locations. The other end of the cave is a deep river. The challenge is to avoid any contact with these cockroaches which can be fatal and avoid falling into the river. However, a treasure collection can rejuvenate the player to enable to collect further treasures. The game gets over when the player runs out available lives. The player, like a cat, is endowed with 9 lives to start with.
